In this project, you are a Pirate ship traveling through space on a quote-unquote 'Cargoship'. This program uses advanced Object-Oriented Programming in Java via ArrayList. 
This is what the program looks at upon loading:

Welcome to the BlackStar Cargo Hold interface.
Please select a number from the options below:

1: Add an item to the cargo hold.
2: Remove an item from the cargo hold.
3: Sort the contents of the cargo hold.
4: Search for an item.
5: Display the items in the ship hold.
6: Decode intercepted message
7: Unload/load items
8: Ransack an item
0: Exit the BlackStar Cargo Hold interface.

I haven't implemented a 'back' function yet or Noded Structure, but the professor did a bad job explaining how to in class and proceeded to not assist me directly.
